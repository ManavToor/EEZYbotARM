<h1>EEZYbotARM</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I had a lot of free time in my highscool tech class so my teacher let me use the 3D printer to build a personal project :) I found a cool 3D printed robot arm online and printed all the pieces and assembled it. The coding and wiring part I did by myself, it was just the 3D printing I got from online<br />
<br />
<b>This is the robot arm:</b><br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-[Link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1015238) to original creator and parts<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-includes 3 servo motors to reach all axis<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-a claw that opens and closes using a servo<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-4 potentiometers to control each servo<br /><br />
<br />
I followed a tutorial to print and assemble the arm, however I did all the wiring and code by myself. I also never took pictures of the arm for some reason, so here is the one my teacher put in the highscool yearbook<br />
